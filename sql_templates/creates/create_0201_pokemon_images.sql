/**
 * All the image names with some additional information
 * about the pictured pok√©mon.
 *
 * You could possibly consider all fields beside name and file_name
 * to be calculated values as they are but the logic behind it is quite
 * complicated so we're probably better off simply doing this once in PHP during
 * the generation phase rather than every single time we want to queue this table.
